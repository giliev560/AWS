The syntax for embedding image in markdown file is
###      ![]()
In the brackets, anything can be added to describe the image, and it will <b>
show as the cursor hovers over the image. <b>
In parenthesis, the image file name with its path needs to be entered. <b>
If the image is taken from a website, the url link needs to be entered. <b>
The path can be the relative path of the image compare to the folder <b>
where the markdown file is. The image needs to be in the same folder <b>
as the markdown file or in a subfolder of that folder. <b>
Also, the image(s) can be uploaded on github and the markdown file, <b>
when uploaded to github, can use the image's github url link.
